# After-Action Report: RAM Upgrade ‚Äì DeathSquadron

**Date:** 2025-06-24  
**Subject:** Successful upgrade of DeathSquadron's memory module  
**Commander:** CBreault808  
**Ship ID:** DeathSquadron (Primary Node)

---

## üìå Summary

A new 16GB DDR4 RAM kit was successfully installed in the DeathSquadron server. The upgrade aimed to improve resource availability for existing and future VM deployments. Post-installation checks via the Proxmox GUI confirmed 15.53GB of available memory.

---

## üîß Actions Taken

- Powered down DeathSquadron for hardware access  
- Installed 2x8GB DDR4 RAM sticks into available DIMM slots  
- Rebooted into Proxmox VE environment  
- Verified hardware recognition through Proxmox GUI (`Summary` tab of node)  
- Attempted CLI verification using `dmidecode`, which failed due to unsigned and inaccessible repositories  
- Decided against modifying APT source lists due to potential system impact

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome

- **Success:** RAM upgrade confirmed operational
- **Observed Memory:** 15.53GB total usable (system reserve accounted for)
- **VM Performance Impact:** To be monitored, but expected to improve resource allocation flexibility
- **CLI Inspection (Deferred):** Full spec inspection postponed to avoid modifying system repositories on a critical node

---

## üì° Tactical Note

Future CLI experimentation (e.g., tuning, package installs, repo edits) should be conducted on a non-critical system. The current plan is to eventually reassign the **ISS Tyrant** as a testbed platform once **Captain Ozzel** and crew are transferred to a newer vessel.

---

## üìç Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor memory consumption trends across VMs  
- [ ] Log any performance-related anomalies or benefits post-upgrade  
- [ ] Prepare ISS Tyrant for reassignment as a Proxmox testing ship  
- [ ] Resume CLI package tests (e.g., `dmidecode`) in isolated environment
