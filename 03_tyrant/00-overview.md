## üéØ Assigned Role

The ISS Tyrant serves as a **guinea pig system** for simulating real-world end-user issues and conducting remote diagnostics from ISS Devastator (Ubuntu help desk VM). It is intended to receive:
- Simulated malfunctions
- Startup bloat
- System slowness
- Troubleshooting scenarios aligned with A+ certification practice

---

## üß∞ Recent Operations

- Recovered from system updates and long boot delay
- Serial number verified via PowerShell (`wmic bios get serialnumber`)
- Initial cleanup performed (disabling startup entries, terminating high-CPU processes)

---

## üß≠ Recommendations

- **RAM Upgrade** to 8 GB if possible for better simulation stability
- **Storage Check** to confirm drive type (HDD vs SSD)
- Maintain regular update checks to avoid hangups during shutdowns
- Assign secondary tasks once stable (e.g. Active Directory join, file access simulation)
