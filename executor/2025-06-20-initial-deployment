- Set static hostname to `executor`
- Updated package list and installed core system tools:
  - `openssh-server` for remote access
  - `ufw` for basic firewall control
  - `fail2ban` for brute-force SSH protection
  - `auditd` for user and system activity logging
- Verified service status:
  - SSH accessible within the internal lab
  - UFW enabled with restrictive default policy
  - Fail2Ban jail active and watching auth log
  - Auditd logging system events to `/var/log/audit/audit.log`
